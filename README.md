# ProperWeb
`This project is still in development and unfit for production.`

The (opinionated) proper way to develop websites. Tired of typing long, complex scripts for doing something as simple as adding another HTML element to your DOM? Do you want to be able to build HTML sites in components, but without having to look for odd formatting and highlighting systems? Perhaps you will enjoy Proper Web, then.
