# Proper Web
`Warning: This project is heavily in development and is mainly intended as a proof of concept at this stage.`

The (opinionated) proper way to develop websites. Tired of typing long, complex scripts for doing something as simple as adding another HTML element to your DOM? Do you want to be able to build HTML sites in components, but without having to look for odd formatting and highlighting systems? Perhaps you will enjoy Proper Web, then.
